# Difficulty Rating System
**Note:** This section is mainly about the 7keys playmode. Other playmodes, like 9keys (pms) or 14keys (double play) have different rating systems.

There are multiple different scales used to rate BMS songs. The Normal (☆), Insane (★), Overjoy (★★), Satellite (**sl**) and Stella (**st**) scales are the most common standard scales.

Simply put, the standard scale goes from ☆1 to ☆12, then ★1 to ★25, and ★★1 to ★★7. There is some overlap between the Insane and Overjoy scales, where ★21 = ★★1 and ★25 = ★★5. A full side-by-side comparison of the level ranges (including Satellite and Stella) is given in a table below.

- Note 1: There are non-standard scales, like the LN (◆) and Scratch (◎) scales)
- Note 2: The Normal2 (▽) and  the Insane2 (▼) tables use ▽ and ▼ instead of ☆ and ★. They mean  the same thing.

The difficulty levels of the standard scales can be roughly divided into three broad categories:
### Normal Range 　　 (levels ☆1 to ☆12)
- Video references for some difficulty levels in this range:

# What are Difficulty Tables?

Difficulty tables are curated lists of "recommended" charts to play. These tables do not contain the charts or songs themselves. They are simply lists of charts (containing chart hashes so that the game can identify the charts).
Charts in difficulty tables are listed by difficulty.

An example of a well-known difficulty table is the [Insane scale](http://www.ribbit.xyz/bms/tables/insane.html), which divides charts into 25 levels, ★1 to ★25. For example, when we say a chart is ★10, it means it belongs to ★10 on the insane scale.

After loading a difficulty table into your BMS player (e.g. beatoraja), you will be able to see the list of charts in-game, and can play the charts by selecting them from the table. However, you will need to have the songs/charts already downloaded (i.e. somewhere in your BMS folder) before you can play them. 
See [downloading songs/charts](Downloading-Songs) for more information.

# Why use difficulty tables?

As BMS events are open for anyone to create and submit songs/charts, by design there is no quality control on the submissions. BMS events will contain both high and low quality songs/charts.
Difficulty tables, in a sense, work as some sort of quality filter.

Difficulty tables also serve as level ratings for charts. The level indicated on the chart itself is set by the chart creator, and this level may not be accurate. The levels in the difficulty tables are decided by the creator of the table, and often has gone through some discussion within the community.


# What are Dan Courses?

Courses can be included in difficulty tables. Among these courses are what people call "dan courses". A dan course is a specific set of (usually 4) songs used to test one's ability. In a course, you have to clear the sequence of given songs using a single health gauge that carries between songs. A player is said to have achieved a dan rank if they are able to clear the dan course corresponding to that rank.

The current "standard" set of dan courses used in BMS is the GENOSIDE 2018 dan courses. This is a set of 22 courses. In order of increasing difficulty, the courses are:
- GENOSIDE 2018 初段 (normal 1st dan) to GENOSIDE 2018 十段 (normal 10th dan)
- GENOSIDE 2018 発狂初段 (insane 1st dan) to GENOSIDE 2018 発狂十段 (insane 10th dan)
- GENOSIDE 2018 発狂皆伝 (insane kaiden)
- GENOSIDE 2018 overjoy

The song list for each of these courses can be viewed here: [GENOSIDE 2018 Dan Courses](http://www.dream-pro.info/~lavalse/LR2IR/search.cgi?mode=gradelist)

There are also other similar dan courses, like the Satellite/Stella courses, or the LN dan courses.

All the songs required for the GENOSIDE 2018 dan courses are included in the [GENOSIDE 2018 Starter Package](http://nekokan.dyndns.info/~lobsak/genocide/grade.html) (with a few exceptions, listed below). You may also need to download the Append package and merge it into the GENOSIDE 2018 folder. (the Append package contains additional charts, which may be needed for the insane dans.)

These are the only dan songs missing from the GENOSIDE 2018 Starter Package:
- ★20 ひつぎとふたご [7KEY/LUNATIC] - for insane 9th dan course
- ★24 Love & Justice [GOD] - for insane kaiden course
- ★25 FREEDOM DiVE [FOUR DIMENSIONS] - for overjoy course

# Using difficulty tables in beatoraja
**Note: If you are using Lunatic Rave 2 (LR2) instead of beatoraja, you need to use BeMusicSeeker to set up difficulty tables.**
- [How to set up difficulty tables in LR2 using BeMusicSeeker](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RrA3_hxXv5Czr1mKs7vdrjLMAGhPb5pTGoJwD3LZ-AQ/edit#slide=id.g5ddf250169_0_61)

beatoraja tables use the same table format as glassist/BeMusicSeeker. Tables are hosted on webpages, and these pages have embedded .json data files containing the table data.

![difficulty table in beatoraja](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/77373171-df006880-6d3d-11ea-9190-f67b4462256a.png)

To use a table in beatoraja, go to the `Resources` tab in the beatoraja config, and add the [table's URL](#popular-difficulty-tables) into the list of table URLs. By default, the list already contains some common tables, like the Normal2, Insane2 and LN tables. The next section in this guide has a list of table URLs.

However, none of these tables will load until you click on `Load difficulty table` at the bottom of the config. This button fetches the table data from the webpages in the list.

After clicking on `Load difficulty table`, you should be able to see the tables in-game.

When scrolling through the tables in-game, you might find songs that have their names in red. This means you do not have the song/chart currently downloaded. Selecting an undownloaded song in beatoraja will open up the download links for the song and the chart in your default browser.


### How do I play dan courses in beatoraja?

**Note: beatoraja courses are stored in tables. LR2 course files (.lr2crs files) cannot be used in beatoraja.**

The following courses are available by default (just click `Load difficulty table` in the config). Do note that you still need the songs downloaded before you can play the courses.
- The **GENOSIDE 2018 Normal** dans (初段 - 十段) can be found in the **Normal2** table.
- The **GENOSIDE 2018 Insane** dans (発狂初段 - overjoy) can be found in the **Insane2** table.
- The LN dans can be found in the LN table.

You can play other courses by adding their respective course table links.
- Satellite Skill Analyzer and Stella Skill Simulator have beatoraja course table links on the [Satellite/Stella](https://stellabms.xyz/skill) website. (click "for beatoraja users")

All of these dan courses include a contraint that forces beatoraja to use the LR2 dan gauge, to ensure consistency in difficulty with the same dan courses in LR2.

# Recommended Difficulty Tables

The following three tables cover the full range of BMS levels, and are highly recommended because they feature modern BMS songs with generally high-quality charts. Refer to the [Difficulty Rating System](#difficulty-rating-system) section for examples of charts in these difficulty ranges.
### [Ikeda's Beginner Difficulty table](http://fezikedifficulty.futene.net/list.html)
 - Covers levels in the normal range, specifically ☆1-☆11
 - This level range is split into 19 denominations (田一 to 田十九)
 - 田一 is approximately ☆1 and 田十九 is approximately ☆11+.

 - Generally covers levels in the insane range, specifically ☆11-★19
 - This level range is split into 13 denominations (sl0 to sl12)
 - sl0 is approximately ☆11/☆12 and sl12 is approximately ★18+/★19-
### [Stella Table](https://stellabms.xyz/st/table.html)
 - Generally covers levels in the overjoy range, specifically ★20-★★7
 - This level range is split into 12 denominations (st0 to st11)
 - st0 is approximately ★19+/★20 and st11 is approximately ★★7

**Note:** If you have exhausted the Satellite or Stella table and are looking to play a much wider variety of charts, I recommend looking at [Hex's Insane Chart Collections](#hexs-insane-chart-collections-recommended).

# Popular Difficulty Tables

This section contains a brief list of some of the more commonly-used tables. For a more extensive list of tables, please refer to [Ribbit's list of difficulty tables](http://www.ribbit.xyz/bms/tables/table_list.html).

The Normal2, Insane2 and LN tables are included in beatoraja by default.

- Some tables (Satellite, Stella, Normal1, Insane1) favor **Quality** over Quantity. They are more useful if you want to restrict yourself to specially selected, "better" charts (or like aiming for folder lamps).
- Other tables (Normal2, Insane2, Hex's tables) favor **Quantity** over Quality. They have a more relaxed or nonexistent quality filter but have many more charts. They are useful for exploring a large quantity of different charts, with more interesting charting styles.

**Note:** To add these tables to beatoraja (or BeMusicSeeker), use the table links given below.

## Old Normal / Insane Tables

### [Normal table (☆)](http://www.ribbit.xyz/bms/tables/normal.html)
- Levels rated from ☆1-☆12. Covers the "IIDX" level range.
- ☆12 correspons to the easiest 12s in IIDX. Anything harder than the easiest 12s is in the insane scale.

### [Insane table (★)](http://www.ribbit.xyz/bms/tables/insane.html)
- Levels rated from ★1-★25. These 25 levels subdivide the level "12" in the IIDX level range.

### [Overjoy table (★★)](http://lr2.sakura.ne.jp/overjoy.php)
- Levels rated from ★★1-★★7. ★★1 corresponds to ★21 and ★★5 corresponds to ★25.

## New Normal / Insane Tables

### [Normal2 table (▽)](http://bmsnormal2.syuriken.jp/table.html)
- Similar to the Normal table, but contains more recent songs, and is more frequently updated. Songs rated from ▽1-▽12.
- Favors **quantity** over quality

### [Insane2 table (▼)](http://bmsnormal2.syuriken.jp/table_insane.html)
- Similar to the Insane table, but contains more recent songs, and is more frequently updated. Songs rated from ▼0-▼25.
- Favors **quantity** over quality

## Satellite and Stella Tables (RECOMMENDED)

### [Satellite table (**sl**)](https://stellabms.xyz/sl/table.html)
- A new table containing many high quality charts. New songs are added every two weeks by a system of community voting. More information can be found here: [Satellite/Stella website](https://stellabms.xyz/help)
- Charts are rated on a scale of sl0-sl12. Covers the level range ☆11-★19.

### [Stella table (**st**)](https://stellabms.xyz/st/table.html)
- A new table containing many high quality charts. New songs are added every two weeks by a system of community voting. More information can be found here: [Satellite/Stella website](https://stellabms.xyz/help)
- Charts are rated on a scale of st0-st11. Covers the level range ★19 and up, as well as the overjoy difficulty range.

## Hex's Insane Chart Collections (RECOMMENDED)

### [Hex's Insane Chart Database](https://bms.hexlataia.xyz/tables/db.html)
- A massive table that catalogues basically every BMS chart and assigns them level ratings (both default charts and sabuns).
- Only contains charts of difficulty ☆11 and above (I wish there was a similar table for normal scale charts).
- Very useful table if you have a lot of event packs. The table assigns level ratings to the charts in your event packs, giving you **a lot** of charts to play.

### [Hex's BMS Sabun Uploader Table](https://bms.hexlataia.xyz/tables/hinanjoy.html)
- A table that catalogues and rates all charts that have been uploaded to the [BMS Sabun Uploader](http://gnqg.rosx.net/upload/)
- Very useful table for playing a much larger quantity/variety of charts, without a quality filter.

### [Hex's Stella Uploader Table](https://bms.hexlataia.xyz/tables/stuploader.html)
- Similar to the BMS Sabun Uploader table, but for the [Stella Uploader](https://stellabms.xyz/uploader) instead.
- Not to be confused with the Stella table. The Stella Uploader is not restricted to Stella-level charts. Stella charts are not necessarily on the Stella Uploader either. They are completely separate entities despite having similar names.

## Other Types of Tables

### [Scratch (sara) table (◎)](http://minddnim.web.fc2.com/sara/3rd_hard/bms_sara_3rd_hard.html)
- For scratch charts.

### [LN (long note) table (◆)](http://flowermaster.web.fc2.com/lrnanido/gla/LN.html)
- For LN charts. Not frequently updated.
