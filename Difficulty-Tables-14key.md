# Difficulty Rating System
**Note:** This page focuses on tables for the 14keys (double play) playmode. For a general introduction to tables and courses, or to browse recommendations for 7keys (single play) mode, see [Difficulty Tables](Difficulty-Tables).

Like 7keys, there are multiple different scales used to rate 14keys charts for BMS songs. The Normal (☆), Insane (★), Overjoy (★★), and Satellite (**DPsl**) are the most common standard scales, and the progression of difficulty between them is similar to their counterparts in 7key mode.

14keys difficulty tables are generally arranged based on the difficulty of achieving an EASY CLEAR, rather than a NORMAL CLEAR.

# Recommended Difficulty Tables

The available selection of charts for 14keys mode is much smaller than for 7keys, so tables tend to fall into two categories: "curated" tables, which are meant to present a cross-section of high-quality or practical charts, and "variety tables" which merely attempt to assign reasonable ratings to any and all charts available.

Pattern makers often catalog their own works into table format, so it can also be worth your time to load up your favorite pattern maker's table.

## Normal Range
Covers levels ☆12 and below.

At this range, difficulty tables may not be necessary. Simply playing by the chart's rated level from some well-established packs (e.g. [GENOSIDE 2018](Downloading-Songs#starter-packs)) may often suffice. However, there is no harm in adding tables to add level ratings to the charts you have.

#### Curated tables:
- [δ: DP delta](http://dpbmsdelta.web.fc2.com/table/dpdelta.html)
  - Includes GENOSIDE 2018 normal dan courses (more or less parallel to IIDX 初段～十段)
- [☆: sagoo's upper-normals table "\_(┐「ε:)\_\[DのPの難易度表\]\_(:3」∠)\_"](http://bmsagoo.soudesune.net/list_dpnodp.html)
  - Only covers ☆9~☆12, but highly recommended for players challenging that range, because sagoo subcategorizes the charts by matching the popular decimal breakdown presented by [SNJ@KMZS](https://zasa.sakura.ne.jp/dp/)
- [白: kuro's curated table "通常DP難易度表"](http://dpbmschart.web.fc2.com/normal-chart/normal_chart.html)
  - Only covers ☆7~☆12

#### Variety tables:
- [☆: Bluvel's allplayer table "DPBMSと諸感"](https://yaruki0.net/DPlibrary/)
  - Highly recommended for players challenging ☆8s through ☆11s, because Bluvel breaks up those ratings into "weak/mid/strong" (弱・中・強) categories
- [☆: mochaIR Level Review Selection 14KEYS Normal](http://zris.work/bmstable/lrs_14n.htm) (mirrored by Zris)
  - A collection of unscreened user feedback from beatoraja's internet ranking endpoint mochaIR; ratings may not be reliable but function well as a starting point

## Insane Range
Covers levels ☆11 and up.

#### Curated tables:
- [**DPsl**: DP Satellite](https://stellabms.xyz/dp/table.html)
  - DPsl scale is meant to match DP Insane numeric ratings, but in reality DPsl`N` tends to line up with ★`N-1`
  - Includes DPsl Skill Analyzer courses (IIDX 九段 and up; IIDX 皆伝 roughly corresponds to DPsl7-8 Skill Analyzer, and IIDX 極皆伝 to DPsl10-11 Skill Analyzer)
  - For a larger selection but shakier ratings, try the [DP Satellite all-submissions table](https://stellabms.xyz/dp/table_sub.html)
- [★: DP Insane](http://dpbmsdelta.web.fc2.com/table/insane.html)
  - Includes GENOSIDE 2018 insane dan courses (IIDX 十段 and up; IIDX 皆伝 roughly corresponds to DP発狂七段, and IIDX 極皆伝 to DP発狂九段)
  - Charts in the DP Insane table tend to be rougher around the edges and much older than DP Satellite selections
- [黒: kuro's curated table "DPBMS黒難易度表(発狂)"](http://dpbmschart.web.fc2.com/normal-chart/normal_chart.html)
- [**nya**★: にゃむ's curated table "NY4M難易度表(仮)"](https://nyamdxy.web.fc2.com/table_ny4m_dp.html)

#### Variety tables:
- [★: mochaIR Level Review Selection 14KEYS Insane](http://zris.work/bmstable/lrs_14i.htm) (mirrored by Zris)
  - A collection of unscreened user feedback from beatoraja's internet ranking endpoint mochaIR; ratings may not be reliable but function well as a starting point
- [**14key**闇★: objeCraft's allplayer table "発狂14keyBMS闇鍋難易度表"](https://kenpel.github.io/objeCraft/table14/)
- [◎: DP Scratch](http://www.ribbit.xyz/bms/tables/dpsara.html) ("DP皿難易度表"; 皿 = "sara", plate)

## Overjoy Range
[★★: DP Overjoy](http://ereter.net/dpoverjoy/) covers levels ★11 and up.

## Patterner Catalogs
- [ぷ: plum](http://plum812.yu-nagi.com/table.html) (☆10~★★)
  - plum often uses CN/HCN tags.
