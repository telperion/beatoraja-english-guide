Note: This version of beatoraja-config.bat is used when you have downloaded the "-jre-win64" version of beatoraja. It runs the build of Java that is in the jre folder in the beatoraja directory.

In other words, only use this version if you see a "jre" folder in your beatoraja directory (it contains a portable version of Java).

This file comes with the [UTF-8 fix](https://github.com/wcko87/beatoraja-english-guide/wiki#locale-fix) already included.
