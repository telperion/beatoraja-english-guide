This page lists beatoraja-specific skins.

[**Discussion thread for this Wiki page**](https://github.com/wcko87/beagetoraja-english-guide/discussions/20)

**Note:** You can mix and match skins. The skin is chosen separately for each menu type.
- For example, not many skins support the Course Result screen, so it might be worth picking up one of the skins that supports it just for the Course Result screen.

**Tip:** You can configure skins in-game by pressing F12.

To search for skins for a specific menu, you can search for the menu type with Ctrl+F (e.g. Music Select, Decide, Result, Play, 7Keys, 9Keys, Course Result).

- **Music Select**: The main screen you see after you start the game.
- **Decide**: The splash screen that shows up when you start a song.
- **Play**: The skin while playing a song.
  - A different play skin can be used for each play mode (7Keys, 5Keys, 9Keys, 14Keys, 24Keys etc).
- **Result**: The score screen that shows after a song is over.
- **Course Result**: The score screen after you pass/fail a course.

Not all of the skins listed have screenshots. That is because the author did not provide screenshots, and I am too lazy to take screenshots on my own. If anyone has tried those skins, it would be nice if you could contribute some screenshots.

# Setting Custom Backgrounds

Most result screens come with default background images. It is however common practice for many players to personalize their result screens by replacing these background images with their own. Result skins often make this easy to do.

This applies to both beatoraja and Lunatic Rave 2.

If you look in the skin folder for your result skin, you may find a set of folders that look like this:
* AAA
* AA
* A
* CLEAR
* FAILED

There may already be some pre-existing background images in these folders. You can remove these images and add your own images to these folders. The images in these folders are the result screen backgrounds corresponding to each grade. This is so that you can set different result screen backgrounds when you get an AAA, AA, A, B or below, or when you fail the chart.

**Note:** In beatoraja, you may need to set the default result screen background to "Random" in the skin config in order for the skin to randomly choose an image from the folder to display.

Other skin assets can also be modified (and made to be randomly selected) in a similar way. Some commonly modified skin assets are:
- Decide screen background
- Music Select background
- Play screen background
- Play screen lane cover
- Play screen pacemaker background (if separate from play screen background)

You can also replace these backgrounds with videos (i.e. animated backgrounds). It may require a bit of tinkering though, by changing the file extension of the skin assets defined in the skin. [Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27341392/122307541-82dac300-cf45-11eb-9b2b-80437f776320.mp4)

# Skin Modifications
This section lists some unofficial skin modifications that some people have made.

More will be added to this section later on.

- [**LITONE5 Table Font Color Replacements**](#litone5-table-font-color-replacements)


## Different Judge Fonts and Note Skins for ModernChicPlay
Adds judge fonts to ModernChicPlay from older BMS players like LR2, nazoBMplay and BM98. Made by AOiRO_Manbow.

## LITONE5 Table Font Color Replacements
Replacement for the difficult-to-read black table font text that's in LITONE by default.
Pink text is made by Reasonance. The other colors were made by me.
- **NOTE:** These replacement files were from an older version of LITONE5. If you are using a more recent version of the skin, you may have to edit the `font.lr2font` file in the same folder and change the `.cim` extensions to `.tga`.

# Using LR2 Skins in beatoraja

External references / More information:
- (EN) by Mr. Mary: https://marysiamzawka.github.io/2021/01/22/lr2-skins-beatoraja.html

beatoraja supports the skin format used by LR2, so LR2 skins can be used in beatoraja. In practice,
- **Play/Decide/Result Skins**: most skins will work almost perfectly (only minor graphical bugs), but may require a few small fixes, described below.
- **Music Select Skins**: Music Select skins made for LR2 should not be used in beatoraja, as the underlying mechanics are very different in LR2, making the skins pretty much unusable beyond selecting songs.

This is a compability chart for LR2 playskins with videos:
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AUDbW_DT3uHEjYRQuo9Ul_YHNcO9LTUyQixvJo_ous0

When using an LR2 Play skin in beatoraja, there are a couple of things (as of 0.8.0) to be aware of:
* Each LR2 skin will include 4 new options to change from within the Skin Select menu: 
  * **BGA Size:** Normal (original aspect ratio of the BGA is retained) or Extend (BGA fills the entire area designated for it)
  * **Ghost:** location of the Pacemaker counter
  * **Score Graph:** analogous to the LR2 setting
  * **Judge Detail (Fast/Slow or +-ms):**
    * If the skin includes a Fast/Slow display (achieved in LR2 by using modified clients), beatoraja will disregard it. Instead it will introduce its own F/S display, which you'll be able to move and resize.
* While the **Lift** modifier technically works as intended, LR2 playskins will introduce visual bugs (explained [here](https://github.com/exch-bms2/beatoraja/issues/572)).
* The **EX-HARD** gauge will appear as HARD gauge, and will be reported in the skin's visuals as Hazard/Sudden Death. (This is a purely visual issue)
* **Mines** may not show (generally doesn't matter except in gimmick charts)

## Fixes you may need to apply
* **Fonts:** Some skins may require "unpacking" their fonts if they are contained within .dxa files, as beatoraja cannot process this format (see: [Unpacking .dxa fonts](#unpacking-dxa-fonts)).
* **Turntable Laser:** If the skin doesn't allow you to switch the behavior of the TT laser, you may have to modify the skin file (see: [Sticking TT laser if using a controller](#sticking-tt-laser-if-using-a-controller)).
* **Resolution Issues:**
  * LR2HD and LR2FHD skins will not be detected correctly. When loaded in beatoraja, only a small 640x480 box from the top left of the skin will be visible, and stretched to fill the window. This can be fixed with a one-line edit of the skin file (see: [Correcting the size of HD and FHD skins](#correcting-the-resolution-of-hd-and-fhd-skins))
  * LR2 SD (640x480) skins will be stretched to fill the 16:9 window. This can be fixed by letterboxing in the skin config (see: [Letterboxing instead of stretching SD skins](#letterboxing-instead-of-stretching-sd-skins))

Everything else (skin customization, White/Green Number, stats display) will work fine.

### Unpacking .dxa fonts

LR2 uses the .dxa format for compressing fonts. beatoraja cannot handle this format out of the box, and thus will not draw any text which uses those fonts.
- To fix this, you only need to "decode" the .dxa files.
- This is done with a tool called "DxaDecode". It isn't hard to acquire - it also comes with LR2.
- All you need to do is to drag all .dxa files, **one by one**, into DxaDecode.exe. DxaDecode will then generate a folder with the same name as the file it processed, which contains the unpacked fonts. These fonts will work in beatoraja.

### Sticking TT laser if using a controller

This is related to how the turntable laser looks when the turntable is constantly being turned (or when the turntable key is held down).
- **Behavior 1:** In some beatoraja skins and in IIDX, a short flash is shown only when the turntable starts spinning. The laser does not linger.
- **Behavior 2:** In LR2 skins, the turntable laser will remain for as long as the turntable is spinning (or when the key is held down)
  - This latter behavior may look awkward to those using a controller, as the laser remains for some time after the turntable is flicked (as a turntable does not immediately stop).

Behavior 2 is what we call "sticking. Some skins like WMIX will let you change this in the skin settings (look for any turntable-related settings). If this is not the case, you can fix the laser by manually editing the skin file.

1. Locate the .csv file related to the skin you're using (for example `MySkin/csv/left_AC.csv`) and open it in a text editor.
1. Find the part of the code responsible for lasers (look for "レーザ" or "laser").
1. Usually the code is nicely described, which makes this step easier. Identify the code responsible for the turntable laser ("timer" value is 100, also can be marked with "SC") and **remove it** (it's usually 1 line starting with `#SRC_IMAGE` and two lines starting with `#DST_IMAGE`).
1. Now find the part responsible for "laser off" animations ("レーザーオフ").
1. Again, locate the code responsible for the turntable laser off ("timer" value is 120), but this time **change the "timer" value to 100**.
1. Save the file and test the skin in-game. The turntable laser should now do a short animation as if you had instantly let go of the button.

### Correcting the resolution of HD and FHD skins

By default beatoraja assumes that all LR2 skins target the "SD" client, which uses the 640x480 resolution, but there are also hacked LR2 clients which support the HD (1280x720) and FHD (1920x1080) resolutions. Beatoraja is not able to recognize the target resolution of a regular LR2 skin, but it can be fixed with a one-line edit to the skin file.

1. Locate the .lr2skin file of the skin you're using (for example `MySkin/play_7.lr2skin`) and open it in a text editor.
1. Add a new line at the very beginning of the file with `#RESOLUTION,X,`, where `X` is 1 for a HD (1280x720) skin, and 2 for a FHD (1920x1080) skin.
1. Save the file and test the skin in-game.

### Letterboxing instead of stretching SD skins
If you use a 640x480 skin in 16:9 beatoraja, by default, the skin stretches to fill the whole window. To letterbox instead of stretch the skin,

1. In the skin configuration, look for "All offset(%)" in the skin config (it should be near the bottom)
2. Set the `w` value to `-25` (this scales the skin down horizontally by -25%)
3. Set the `x` value to either `12` (centered), `0` (align left) or `25` (align right).
