This page lists beatoraja-specific skins.

**Note:** You can mix and match skins. The skin is chosen separately for each menu type.
- For example, not many skins support the Course Result screen, so it might be worth picking up one of the skins that supports it just for the Course Result screen.

To search for skins for a specific menu, you can search for the menu type with Ctrl+F (e.g. Music Select, Decide, Result, Play, 7Keys, 9Keys, Course Result).

Not all of the skins listed have screenshots. That is because the author did not provide screenshots, and I am too lazy to take screenshots on my own. If anyone has tried those skins, it would be nice if you could contribute some screenshots.

**Note:** There is another list of beatoraja skins (in JP) here: https://w.atwiki.jp/laser_bm/pages/129.html

# Skin Modifications
This section lists unofficial skin modifications that some people have made.

More will be added to this section later on.

## LITONE5 Table Font Color Replacements
Replacement for the difficult-to-read black table font text that's in LITONE by default.
Pink text is made by Reasonance. The other colors were made by me.
- **NOTE:** These replacement files were from an older version of LITONE5. If you are using a more recent version of the skin, you may have to edit the `font.lr2font` file in the same folder and change the `.cim` extensions to `.tga`.

# Lunatic Rave 2 Skins

beatoraja supports the skin format used by LR2, which means that you'll be able to use LR2 skins within beatoraja.
In practice majority of Play skins are 99% compatible (only minor graphical bugs), but may require a bit of manual maintenance to achieve this state. While Decide and Result skins are also mostly compatible, you should not use Music Select skins made for LR2, as the underlying mechanics are way different in beatoraja, making the skin pretty much unusable beyond selecting songs.

This page lists both LR2 and beatoraja skins:
- https://w.atwiki.jp/laser_bm/pages/129.html

This is another list of LR2 skins:
- https://www.kasacontent.com/skinlist/

This page also lists some LR2 skins (download links only):
- https://bms-community.github.io/resources/#skins

This is a compability chart for LR2 playskins with videos:
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AUDbW_DT3uHEjYRQuo9Ul_YHNcO9LTUyQixvJo_ous0/edit#gid=0

Now, if you want to use a LR2 Playskin in beatoraja, there's a couple of things (as of 0.8.0) that you have to be aware of:
* Each LR2 skin will include 4 new options to change from within the Skin Select menu: 
  * BGA Size: Normal (original aspect ratio of the BGA is retained) or Extend (BGA fills the entire area designated for it)
  * Ghost: location of the Pacemaker counter
  * Score Graph: analogous to the LR2 setting
  * Judge Detail: Fast/Slow or +-ms
    * If your skin included a Fast/Slow display (achieved in LR2 by using modified clients), beatoraja will disregard it. Instead it will introduce its own F/S display, which you'll be able to move and resize.
* Some skins may require "unpacking" their fonts if they're contained within .dxa files, as beatoraja cannot process this format (described below)
* If the skin doesn't allow you to switch the behaviour of the TT laser, you may have to modify the skin file (described below)
* Skins targeting LR2HD and LR2FHD clients will appear stretched out of the box - luckily this can be fixed with a one-line edit of the skin file (described below)
* While Lift modifier technically works as intended, LR2 playskin introduces visual bugs (explained [here](https://github.com/exch-bms2/beatoraja/issues/572))
* The EX-Hard gauge will appear as Hard gauge, and will be reported in skin's visuals as Hazard/Sudden Death. This is only a visual issue - the gauge will still work like EX-Hard
* Mines may not show (does not matter unless you play "gimmick" charts)

Everything else (skin customization, White/Green Number, stats display) will work fine.

## Unpacking .dxa fonts

LR2 used the .dxa format for compressing fonts. Beatoraja cannot handle this format out of the box, and thus will not draw any text which uses those fonts. Luckily to fix that you only need to "decode" the .dxa files.
To do that you will need a tool called "DxaDecode". It isn't hard to acquire - in fact, it comes with LR2!
Now all you need to do is to drag all .dxa files, **one by one**, onto the DxaDecode.exe, and it'll do the rest for you. When it's done, you'll see that it created a folder with the same name as the file it processed, which contains the unpacked fonts, which beatoraja will gladly take!

## Sticking TT laser if using a controller

This issue is caused by design of ASC controller boards, which will bind the turntable to a button/simple axis, effectively turning the analog input into a two-button digital one. When you spin the turntable in either direction, it'll register a button being pressed. When you stop spinning, the button will stay pressed for a brief moment as a safety measure. The issue is that most LR2 skins are made with keyboard use in mind, and thus will treat the TT as a regular button (laser stays on for the entire hold duration), as opposed to how the real IIDX treats it (short animation when you start spinning).
Some skins like WMIX will let you change that in skin settings (look for any turntable-related settings). If that's not the case, you can fix the laser by manually editing the skin file.

1. Locate the .csv file related to the skin you're using (for example` MySexySkin/csv/left_AC.csv`) and open it in your text editor of choice
1. Find the part of the code that is responsible for lasers (look for "レーザ" or "laser")
1. Usually the code is nicely described, which makes this step easier. Identify the code responsible for the turntable laser ("timer" value is 100, also can be marked with "SC") and **remove it** (it's usually 1 line starting with `#SRC_IMAGE` and two lines starting with `#DST_IMAGE`)
1. Now find the part which is responsible for "laser off" animations ("レーザーオフ")
1. Again, locate the code responsible for the turntable laser off ("timer" value is 120), but this time **change the "timer" value to 100**.
1. Save the file and test in-game. If the turntable laser does a short animation as if you instantly let go of a button, the fix worked!

## Correcting the size of HD and FHD skins

By default beatoraja assumes that all LR2 skins target the "SD" client, which uses 640x480 resolution, but there are also hacked clients which support HD (1280x720) and FHD (1920x1080) resolutions. Beatoraja is not able to recognize the target resolution of a regular LR2 skin, but it can be fixed with a one-line edit to the skin file.

1. Locate the .lr2skin file of the skin you're using (for example `MySexySkin/play_7.lr2skin`) and open it in a text editor of your choice
1. Add a new line at the very beginning of the file with `#RESOLUTION,X,`, where `X` is 1 for a HD (1280x720) skin, and 2 for a FHD (1920x1080) skin.
1. Save the file and test in-game
