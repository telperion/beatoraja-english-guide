Beatoraja supports usage of several different Internet Ranking (IR) Services, which allow submission of scores, and may also provide additional IR-specific features.
- Currently, scores can be sent to multiple services at the same time, with one of them set as the "Main IR".
- The Main IR adds certain features to the [music select](Music-Select) screen and is the one used for viewing chart pages when pressing `F11`.
- All IRs will BAN accounts for playing illegal BMS files.

# 1. [Mocha-Repository](https://mocha-repository.info)
The most populated IR, only available bundled with the compiled releases.
- It has rival support, settable course clear badges and a LEVEL REVIEW system.
- These features are available when mocha is set as the main IR.

### LEVEL REVIEW
A feature allowing players to declare the difficulty and comment on the charts they've played, similarly to the popular [STATISTIK](http://statistik.benhgreen.com/IIDX/ratings) website for IIDX. These ratings are then averaged and compiled into LEVEL REVIEW [difficulty table](Difficulty-Tables) for the 7KEY and 14KEY modes, accessible from music select.

### Collections
Users can create collections and courses which others can subscribe to via the mocha website, which adds those folders to the music select screen.

### Gauge Auto Shift
Scores obtained with [Gauge Auto Shift](Configuration#gauge-auto-shift) will be marked with a * in Mocha's website. Only you can see the *.

(It used to be the case that Gauge Auto Shift clears would register as assist clears on MochaIR. This is no longer the case - they now count normally as clears.)

# 2. [MinIR](https://www.gaftalk.com/minir/)
The main unique feature of this IR is the Unique ID which can be used to bind the profile with [Stellaway](https://lite.stellabms.xyz/#/stellaway/beatoraja) for the Satellite and Stella difficulty tables.
- When set as the main IR, it pushes the Satellite and Stella [difficulty tables](Difficulty-Tables) to your client, so it's best to not have them in your table list as it will duplicate them.
- Other unique feature are user-created scoring contests of varying lengths.
- Has rival and course support

# 3. [CitrusIR](https://citrus-ir.iidx.app/)
Another early IR implementation. No specific features when set as the main IR.
