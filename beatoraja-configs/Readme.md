Note: This version of beatoraja-config.bat is used when you have Java installed in your PC.

If you instead have a "jre" folder in your beatoraja directory containing a portable version of Java, go [here](https://github.com/wcko87/beatoraja-english-guide/tree/resources/beatoraja-configs-win64jre) instead.

This file comes with the [UTF-8 fix](https://github.com/wcko87/beatoraja-english-guide/wiki#locale-fix) already included.
